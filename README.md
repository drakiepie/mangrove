# Mangrove

## Soundscape Ecology Analysis Toolkit

Mangrove is a soundscape ecology analysis tool
built to provide a user interface for analytical
algorithms written in the R programming
language. Soundscape ecology is an emerging field that
often times has a high-bar entry for individuals
interested in the study. Therefore, Mangrove was
developed to provide an open source
application that is intuitive and easy to use.

[Dr. Jonathan Beever](http://www.jonathan.beever.org/),
the project sponsor, has seen Mangrove through three 
iterations, in which users can visualize graphical 
outputs alongside listening to this data to more
effectively analyze, communicate, and share
data. Mangrove has a vast set of tools that can
be utilized by biologists and analysts alike to
better understand and interpret how vital a role
sound plays in the environment.

## Special Thank You

We would like to extend our thanks to the [Central Florida Zoo](https://www.centralfloridazoo.org/) for
allowing [Dr. Jonathan Beever](http://www.jonathan.beever.org/) to record the environment at the zoo to
help facilitate soundscape ecology research and develop the Mangrove application.
